# UI-test Sebastian Velasco Borrero

## the challenge
The challenge its to develop the interface in the PNG composition with interactions.
## PNG Composition:
- https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/zemoga-files/ui/candidates-test/test-ui-v2.png
## interactions
Just add interaction in the middle voting boxes: Kanye West, Mark Zuckerberg, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and Malala Yousafzai.
### interaction Requirements:
- Create a data feed in JSON format with the structure that best suits the content for the voting boxes and populate the initial content from it.
- The user can select either thumb up or thumb down button on each of the boxes (when the button is selected, a white border is displayed as featured in the comp)
- Once the user clicks on the "Vote now” button, a message is displayed saying “Thank you for voting!” as well as a vote again button to vote again.
- There is no limit in the amount of votes
- Percentage bars change depending on the up/or downs votes.
- Think on a way to persist the current votes so if the page is refreshed the data is not lost. (could be local in the browser or server side if you have those skills)
- We want to see your vanilla/DOM JS skills so please do not use jQuery.
- You can solve this part with either full Vanilla JS and some patterns, OR any sort of framework such as Angular, React, Vuejs, Ember, etc. Use the one you feel more confortable with.
- Bonus points: Some sort of Test (E2E, BDD, etc)
## Delivery
Show us a glimpse of what you love to do (and know the best of). 👊👊👊
Rely on a readme.md file to reference any key aspect you want to mention about what you applied in the excercise and/or any other relevant information about the steps to get the project up and running.
Send a link to your recruiter pointing to your repository (Github, Bitbucket) including 2 branches. One with the layout part and another one with the interactive (and NodeJS if applies) part. The master branch should contain the entire exercise.
